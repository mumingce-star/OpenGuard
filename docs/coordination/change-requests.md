## CR-20260905-B1-B7-closure

- Requested by: CZ, 2026-09-05.
- Scope: continue B1–B7 implementation using the frozen P0 domain contract.
- Target files: `backend/app/scanners/`, `backend/app/licenses/`, `backend/app/detectors/`, `benchmarks/`, and their unit fixtures/tests.
- Ownership impact: backend implementation is normally Terra-owned and test/bench content Luna-owned. The user explicitly authorized direct completion in this conversation.
- Contract impact: additive modules only. `Resource`/`Evidence`/`RiskFinding` P0 schema, source-evidence gate, and no-legal-advice semantics remain unchanged.
- Verification: deterministic fixture tests, schema-compatible model construction, `compileall`, and targeted pytest. Linux-only external-tool ZIP gates remain separately reported if the host cannot evidence them.
